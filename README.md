My interests and expertises expand from graphics- , motion- and sound-design up to programming in lots of different languages like **C#, Rust, PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL, JavaScript, Kotlin, Java, Objective-C, C, Python and Visual Basic** with the first being my most and last being my least used languages. I mostly use my little free time productively, but if I don't, then I usually play chess, osu!, or Krunker. As a reason of peer pressure I generally hang around on Discord but maintain daily activity on my mail-inbox and couple other forums.
